__________________________________ FLEXT _________________________________

This object needs flext framework built and installed in order to be built.
for more information see http://grrrr.org/research/software/flext

___________________________________ SDK __________________________________

To be built, it also needs an installation of the SDK from sixense which
is downloadable here : http://sixense.com/developers, and flext compiled
with links to it.

__________________________________________________________________________

To only use the binaries (.pd_darwin or .mxo), at least you need to
install the SDK.
Unzip the sixenseSDK_linux_OSX.zip file downloaded from the previously
mentioned address, open a terminal and cd to the newly created
sixenseSDK_linux_OSX folder, then to the install subfolder, then type :
python install.py
When asked, select "osx 32 bits" (choice #5). This script will install
sixense libraries in /usr/local/lib which must be there in order for the
hydra object to work.
